This module monitors the rocket's systems for anomalies or failures and initiates appropriate contingency actions or aborts if necessary.

## Project naming
We named our debugging software after the first programmer who debugged code: Grace Hopper.
In 1945, while working on the Harvard Mark II computer, she discovered an actual moth causing a malfunction,
which she documented as the first "bug" in a computer system.
This incident led to the term "debugging" being coined to describe the process of identifying and fixing issues in computer code.
